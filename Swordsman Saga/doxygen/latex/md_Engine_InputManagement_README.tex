The Update method of Screen\+Manager returns an \mbox{\hyperlink{classInputState}{Input\+State}} Object.

\mbox{\hyperlink{classInputState}{Input\+State}} specifies the position of the mouse as well as a List of Actions.

An Action is either an action that can be performed by \mbox{\hyperlink{classInput}{Input}} from the mouse (e.\+g. what mouse button has been clicked)

of an action that can be performed by \mbox{\hyperlink{classInput}{Input}} from the Keyboard, in which case the actions are already mapped to Actions which are specific to the game.
